Notes: Qt-Java build/integration

This folder does not contain runnable Qt-Java code because linking Qt to Java requires native binaries and platform-specific setup.

If you want to pursue Qt-Java, two realistic paths:
- Find a maintained Qt Jambi distribution for your platform and follow its packaging instructions.
- Or build a small HTTP REST API in Java (embedded Jetty or similar) and implement the Qt/QML frontend separately; the frontend talks to the Java backend.

I can help further once you pick a path.
